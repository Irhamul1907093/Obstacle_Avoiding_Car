# Obstacle_Avoiding_Car
This project involves building an autonomous car using an Arduino board and a Sonar sensor (Ultrasonic sensor). The car is capable of detecting obstacles in its path and avoiding them automatically by altering its direction, providing an effective demonstration of basic robotics and sensor integration.
